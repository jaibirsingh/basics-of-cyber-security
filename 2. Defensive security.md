# Defensive Security

* Mainly focussed on two tasks:
  1. Preventing intrusions from occuring
  2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and respond properly

* Common measures taken by the Blue teams are: 
  1. Cyber Security awareness of the users
  2. Documenting and managing assets: Need to know the types of systems and devices we are trying to protect.
  3. Setup preventative security devices: Firewall = Controls what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network.
  4. Update and patch systems
  5. Setup devices for logging and monitoring: If a new unauthorized device appears on the network, we should be able to know.It won't be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions wothout proper logginng and monitring of the network.

* Areas of defensive security are:
  1. Security Operations Center (SOC) = covers = Threat Intelligence
  2. Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) = covers = Malware Analysis
 

  ## Security Operations Center (SOC)
  ***
  It is a team of cyber security professinals that monitors the network to detect malicious cyber security events.
  Areas of interest:
  1. Vulnerabilities = Install an update or patch, if not possible = take necessary measures to avoid further exploitation. Remediation is, generally, not done by the Blue team.
  2. Policy Violations = Eg: It might be a policy violation if a user uploads confidential company data to an online storage device.
  3. Unauthorized activity: Eg: Stolen username and password
  4. Network intrusion: Eg: A user clicks on a malicious link or a public server exploited.

  * Important task to be covered under SOC ->
  ### Threat Intelligence
  * Intelligence needs data
  * Identify the threat actor(Adversary) -> Predict their activity -> Mitigate the attack and prepare a response strategy
 ***
 ## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

 ### Digital Forensics
 Areas of Digital Forensics:
 1. File System: Forensic image (low-level copy) of a system's storage reveals much inof. like installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files, and deleted files.
 2. System Memory: If the malicious program is in memory without being saved to the disk, low-level copy of the system memory is the best way to analyze.
 3. System logs: Each client and server computer maintain different log files about what is happening. Even if an intruder tries to clear their traces, log files provide plenty of inofrmation about what happened on a system.
 4. Network logs

 ### Incident Response
 An incident usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack; however, in some cases, it can be something less critical, such as a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, or a policy violation.
 
 Incident Response specifies the methodology that should be followed in the case of a cyber attack.

 * Four major phases:
  1. Preparation
  2. Detection and Analysis
  3. Containment, Eradication and Recovery: Once an incident is effective.
  4. Post-Incident Activity: A report is produced, and th elearned lesson is shared to prevent similar incidents in future.

  ### Malware Analysis
  Malware includes many types such as:
 * Virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another; moreover, it works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer. The result ranges from the computer becoming slow to unusable.
 * Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath. For example, a victim might download a video player from a shady website that gives the attacker complete control over their system.
 * Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a “ransom.”

Malware analysis aims to learn about such malicious programs using various means:

1. Static analysis works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. Usually, this requires solid knowledge of assembly language (processor’s instruction set, i.e., computer’s fundamental instructions).
2. Dynamic analysis works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities. It lets you observe how the malware behaves when running.

## Tools 
* There are many open-source databases out there, like AbuseIPDB, and Cisco Talos Intelligence, where you can perform a reputation and location check for the IP address.
* Scenario: You got the permission to block the malicious IP address, and now you can proceed and implement the block rule. Block the malicious IP address on the firewall.
* SIEM(Security Information and Event Management)
