# Offensive Security
***
* To beat a hacker, we need to
  1. behave like a hacker
  2. find vulnerabilities
  3. recommend patches before a cybercriminal does.
* It is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.
